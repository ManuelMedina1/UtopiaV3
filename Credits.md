## Credits

Utopia is based on so much research, by so many people over the course of the years, that it deserved to have its own file, it might also be useful for those that want some resources in the future.

## Core components

- Utopia is powered by the [Linux kernel](https://kernel.org) made by [Linus Tolvards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds)
- Our system library, libSystem, originally derived from [Musl-C](https://musl.libc.org/)
- A lot of the Assembly files were rewritten by [Michael Clark](https://github.com/michaeljclark) for his [Kiwi Project](https://github.com/michaeljclark/musl-xnu)
- Winter borrows some SAT solving code from [Oakmase](https://github.com/AOSC-Dev/omakase), developed by [AOSC](https://github.com/AOSC-Dev)
- Our Core, File and Find utils are derived from [FreeBSD](https://freebsd.org)
- Winter fetch protocol is based on the one made by [FreeBSD](https://freebsd.org)
- `Pledge (1)` system call implementation is derived from [OpenBSD](https://openbsd.org) and was originally developed by [Guillaume Pagnoux](https://github.com/Yumasi)
- Winter's command line interface is based on Novus, developed by [Nikan Radan](https://github.com/SmushyTaco) (SmushyTaco)

## Inspiration

- The file hierarchy is heavily inspired on [GoboLinux](https://gobolinux.org)
- Multiple version support structure is inspired on [Spack](https://github.com/spack) and [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)
- Winter environments are inspired by [Nix](https://nixos.org/)
- Winter's version numbering system is derived from APT which is developed by [Debian](https://debian.org)
- The Winter packaging format is inspired by `xbps` which is developed by [Void Linux](https://voidlinux.org)
- LaunchServices were an idea originally made by [Apple](https://apple.com)
- A system wide configuration database, was originally an idea seen on [Microsoft Windows](https://microsoft.com)
- Winter SATs solver is heavily inspired on libsolv developed by [SUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/)
- The Application format was originally developed by [NeXt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT_Computer)
