## About

Utopia is a concept Operating System, it is a love letter to various other projects, concepts and ideas.

Roughly speaking, the idea is to make a unified userland for the Linux kernel, instead of it being developed into separate components merged together, with Utopia, the system utilities, the system libraries and the init system are developed a whole.

## Where is the documentation?
