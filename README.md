# Utopia :chair:

## Notice

Utopia-v3 project halted, Utopia (v3, since this is actually the third time I try to make an OS) has officially "failed". Due to my lack of knowledge in certain areas, I am not able to keep up with some problems I faced.

Is this the end of me as OS dev?, No! I am not giving up, I will learn to fill the holes and will return with the same dream I have had since I was 13.

For now, you can browse the source code, and take anything you consider useful, I am sure a lot of it will be used in Utopia v4. When Im ready.

An Operating System developed as a whole powered by the Linux kernel.

## About

Utopia is a concept Operating System, it is a love letter to various other projects, concepts and ideas.

Roughly speaking, the idea is to make a unified userland for the Linux kernel, instead of it being developed into separate components merged together, with Utopia, the system utilities, the system libraries, GUI toolkit and guidelines, server implementations and Init system are developed as a whole.

Watch the operating system development on YouTube!

- Manuals can be found at the `Documentation/ManPages` subdirectory.
- In each subdirectory, you will find a `Architecture.md` explaining the organization of the files and design decisions.
- Look for code comments that explain why some decisions were taken.
- Finally you can always look at the documentation on the Utopia website.
