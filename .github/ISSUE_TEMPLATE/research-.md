## About
What is the investigation theme? Why does it need research? Is it a Utopia component? Can you give examples?

Example:
Foo is a program that is implemented in pretty much any other UNIX like operating system, it provides the following features:

- Placeholder
- Woah!

It isn't currently implemented in Utopia, however, it is beneficial, see for example how the placeholder feature could be used when doing X thing!

## Definitions

Does this subject have any ambiguities? Can you define them? 

You might not need to disambiguate every single term, that would be a nightmare! Try to only disambiguate terms that might be easy to confuse, for example TLS and TLS, one stands for “Thread Local Storage” while the other stands for “Transport Layer Security”.

If your research doesn't contain any ambiguous terms, feel free to delete this section.

For example:

Cat: Cat refers to a UNIX command that shows the contents of a FILE

## Information

Any additional information about the goals?

For example

1. Implementing Foo does not plan on making Utopia compatible with Bar!

**If there is no additional information, feel free to delete this section**

## Tasks

Any tasks that we need to do? Where?

For example

- [ ] Do bar

In order to implement foo, we need libSystem to be able to load bar at X offset, this is vital because foo needs bar, and without bar there can't be foo.

**If no tasks are left, feel free to delete this section.**

## Problems

Any problems? Anything you haven't decided?

For example:

Implementing Foo requires a file format to read from, should we use TOML? JSON?

**If there aren't any problems, feel free to delete this section**

## Resources

Any resources where we can learn more? Books? Blog posts? Source code?

For example:

- How to do foo, can be found [here](https://foo.com/thefooprotocol)
- We can read about how Bar handles X at [y](https://y.com/howdoesitdoy)

** If there aren't any resources please research more, before opening the issue, or feel free to delete this section**
